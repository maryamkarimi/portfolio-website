              Hello! My name is Maryam.

              I started programming when I was 12 years old. When I was 14,
              my friends would ask me to design and build themes for their blogs. I joined a
              robotic team when I was 15 years old and built/programmed junior soccer robots
              for three years.
          </h4>

              I&apos;ve always had a strong passion for programming.
              After I graduated from highschool, I moved to Canada to pursue a degree
              in Computer Science.
